## Development Workflow

- **Branch naming**: `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-description`, `docs/what-changed`, `ci/what-changed`, `test/what-changed`
- **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
- **Before submitting**: Run `npm run ci` (typecheck → lint → test → build)

## 15-Job CI/CD Pipeline

Every PR triggers 15 independent CI/CD checks across quality, testing, security, and DevOps:

| # | Job | Runs on PR | Blocks merge |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lint — ESLint | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 2 | TypeCheck — tsc | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 3 | Unit Tests — Vitest | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 4 | Coverage — Vitest | ✅ | ⚠️ Informational |
| 5 | Contract WASM Build | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 6 | Next.js Build | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 7 | E2E — Chromium | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 8 | E2E — Firefox | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 9 | Prisma Validate | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 10 | Docker Build | ✅ | ⚠️ Informational |
| 11 | K8s Validate | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 12 | Helm Lint | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 13 | Secret Scan — Gitleaks | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 14 | npm Audit | ✅ | ⚠️ Advisory |
| 15 | PR Auto-Label | ✅ | ℹ️ No block |

### Branch Protection Rules (recommended)

Configure these in **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules** for `main`:

- **Require a pull request before merging**: ✅
- **Require approvals**: 1 minimum
- **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**: ✅
- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: ✅
  - Required checks: `lint`, `typecheck`, `unit-tests`, `contract-wasm`, `next-build`, `e2e-chromium`, `e2e-firefox`, `prisma-validate`, `k8s-validate`, `helm-lint`, `secret-scan`
- **Require conversation resolution before merging**: ✅
- **Require signed commits**: Recommended
- **Require linear history**: Recommended
- **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**: ✅

### Merge Requirements Summary

> A PR must pass **11 of 15** checks (excludes coverage, npm audit, Docker build, PR labeler) and have at least **1 approving review** before it can be merged to `main`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests (800 frontend)
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run coverage      # Coverage report
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript check
npm run lint          # ESLint
```

## Smart Contracts

Contracts are in `contracts/`. Build with:

```bash
cd contracts/ophirpay && cargo test   # 58 contract tests
cd contracts/emitter && cargo test    # 6 emitter tests
```

Contract WASM size is enforced in CI (hard limit: 128 KB per contract, the
Soroban protocol limit) and a per-function gas report is uploaded as a build
artifact — see the `contract-gas-report` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main`: `feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`
2. Make your changes, following existing code conventions
3. Run `npm run ci` locally to verify everything passes
4. Push and open a PR — the 15-job CI pipeline runs automatically
5. Ensure all 11 required checks pass (✅ green)
6. Request review from a maintainer (CODEOWNERS auto-assigns reviewers)
7. Once approved and all checks pass, squash-merge to `main`

## Issue Labels & Their Meanings

OphirPay uses a two-tier label scheme: **plain labels** (semantic) and
**emoji labels** (stack-area). Bounty-eligible work is tagged with a
**`bounty`** label plus a **`Stellar Wave`** program label and a
**`difficulty:`** estimate.

### Semantic labels

| Label | Meaning | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `bug` | Something isn't working | Reproduce, add a failing test, fix, reference `Fixes #…` |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement request | Discuss scope in the issue, then implement |
| `feature` | Larger feature-tracked work | See the linked epic/Roadmap item |
| `documentation` | Docs-only change (guides, README, comments) | Edit docs; keep commands copy-pasteable and verified |
| `good first issue` | Small, well-scoped task for newcomers | Grab it — it's the intended on-ramp |
| `help wanted` | Extra attention needed | Comment to coordinate before starting |
| `question` | Needs clarification, not code | Answer with detail; close once resolved |
| `duplicate` | Already tracked elsewhere | Link the original issue |
| `invalid` | Not a valid issue/PR for this repo | Explain why when closing |
| `wontfix` | Accepted, will not be worked on | Leave a note on the decision |

### Stack-area labels

| Label | Area | Example use |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend` / `🎨 frontend` | UI components, pages, styling | Payment form, dashboard |
| `backend` / `🔧 backend` | API routes, server logic | `/api/payments`, rate limiting |
| `contracts` / `📦 contracts` | Soroban Rust contracts | `contracts/ophirpay`, `contracts/emitter` |
| `security` / `🔒 security` | Auth, RBAC, secrets, audit | `AUTH_SECRET`, governance, multisig |
| `tests` / `🧪 tests` | Vitest/Playwright coverage | New unit or e2e tests |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| `performance` | Gas, latency, bundle size | `docs/GAS.md` related work |
| `devops` / `⚙️ devops` | Docker, Helm, K8s, monitoring | `helm/`, `k8s/`, `monitoring/` |
| `database` / `🗄️ database` | Prisma schema & migrations | `prisma/schema.prisma` |
| `dependencies` / `📦 dependencies` | npm/cargo dependency bumps | Renovate/Dependabot PRs |
| `hooks` / `🪝 hooks` | React hooks | `src/lib/`, custom hooks |
| `types` / `📐 types` | TypeScript types & ABI | `src/types/contract-abi.ts` |
| `lib` / `📚 lib` | Shared libraries | `src/lib/` utilities |
| `docs` / `📝 docs` | Documentation | Guides in `docs/` |

> 💡 **PR auto-labeling**: the `pr-labeler` CI job applies stack-area labels to
> PRs automatically from the changed paths — you don't need to label your PR
> by hand.

## Bounty Process (Stellar Wave)

OphirPay participates in the **Stellar Wave** bounty program. Bounty-eligible
issues carry the **`bounty`** + **`Stellar Wave`** labels and a difficulty
estimate (e.g. `difficulty: medium`). Each bounty issue's acceptance criteria
are the contract for payout — the PR must satisfy them exactly.

### Claiming a bounty

1. **Find a bounty issue** — filter for the `bounty` label (with `Stellar Wave`)
   and read its acceptance criteria + implementation hints.
2. **Comment to claim it**: reply on the issue saying you'd like to take it on
   (e.g. "I'd like to work on this one").
3. **Wait for assignment** — a maintainer will assign you. Do not open a PR
   for a bounty issue before you are assigned.
4. **Create your branch** from `main` using the issue's suggested branch name
   (e.g. `feat(wasm)/compute-WASM-hash-early-and-display-before-simulat`).
5. **Implement** following the issue's key-files hints and this guide's
   conventions (Conventional Commits, `npm run ci` green, tests added).
6. **Open the PR** referencing the issue with **`Closes #<number>`** in the
   description so the issue auto-closes on merge.
7. **Make sure CI is green** — all 11 required checks must pass.
8. **Request review** from a maintainer and respond to feedback.
9. **Merge** — once approved and merged, the bounty issue closes and payout is
   processed per the program's terms.

### Bounty etiquette

- Claim **one issue at a time**; finish it before claiming the next.
- If you can't finish, **unassign yourself** (or comment) early so someone
  else can pick it up.
- **Don't** claim an issue and submit a PR that only partially satisfies the
  acceptance criteria — partial work delays the bounty and the review.
- A PR that references `Closes #…` for a bounty issue is the record of the
  work; keep the description detailed so reviewers can verify every
  acceptance criterion.

## Definition of Done (DoD) for PRs

A PR is **done** — ready for review and merge — when **all** of the following
hold. This mirrors the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
and the 11 required CI checks.

### Functional & code requirements

- [ ] Addresses the issue's acceptance criteria **completely** (docs issues:
  every requested section exists and is accurate)
- [ ] Follows existing code conventions and the repo's style (Prettier + ESLint)
- [ ] No new lint warnings (`npm run lint` clean)
- [ ] No new type errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean)
- [ ] Tests added/updated for the change, and the full suite passes
  (`npm test` — 1,000+ tests; contract changes also need `cargo test`)
- [ ] No new security findings (secret-scan, npm audit advisory level)

### Contract changes (additional)

- [ ] `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release` succeeds for the changed
  contract
- [ ] Contract WASM stays under the 128 KB Soroban protocol limit (CI
  enforces it)
- [ ] Rust tests added/updated in the contract's `src/lib.rs` and passing
- [ ] If the contract ABI changed: TypeScript types updated in
  `src/types/contract-abi.ts`

### Documentation changes (additional)

- [ ] Commands are copy-pasteable and were verified (or clearly marked as
  expectations)
- [ ] New docs are linked from the README or the appropriate index page
- [ ] No typos (`typos` spell-check CI job passes)
- [ ] Cross-links use relative paths so they work on GitHub and in the docs

### Checklist before opening the PR

- [ ] Branch is based on current `main` and named `feat/…`, `fix/…`,
      `docs/…`, `ci/…`, or `test/…`
- [ ] `npm run ci` passes locally (typecheck → lint → test → build)
- [ ] PR description explains **what** changed and **why**, references the
      issue with `Closes #…`, and includes a test plan
- [ ] All 11 required CI checks are green on the PR
- [ ] At least 1 maintainer approval obtained before merge

> If any box can't be ticked, say so explicitly in the PR description with the
> reason — a documented exception beats a silent one.
