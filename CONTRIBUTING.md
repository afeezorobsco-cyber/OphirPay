## Development Workflow

- **Branch naming**: `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-description`, `docs/what-changed`, `ci/what-changed`, `test/what-changed`
- **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
- **Before submitting**: Run `npm run ci` (typecheck → lint → test → build)

## 15-Job CI/CD Pipeline

Every PR triggers 15 independent CI/CD checks across quality, testing, security, and DevOps:

| # | Job | Runs on PR | Blocks merge |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lint — ESLint | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 2 | TypeCheck — tsc | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 3 | Unit Tests — Vitest | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 4 | Coverage — Vitest | ✅ | ⚠️ Informational |
| 5 | Contract WASM Build | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 6 | Next.js Build | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 7 | E2E — Chromium | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 8 | E2E — Firefox | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 9 | Prisma Validate | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 10 | Docker Build | ✅ | ⚠️ Informational |
| 11 | K8s Validate | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 12 | Helm Lint | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 13 | Secret Scan — Gitleaks | ✅ | ✅ Required |
| 14 | npm Audit | ✅ | ⚠️ Advisory |
| 15 | PR Auto-Label | ✅ | ℹ️ No block |

### Branch Protection Rules (recommended)

Configure these in **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules** for `main`:

- **Require a pull request before merging**: ✅
- **Require approvals**: 1 minimum
- **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**: ✅
- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: ✅
  - Required checks: `lint`, `typecheck`, `unit-tests`, `contract-wasm`, `next-build`, `e2e-chromium`, `e2e-firefox`, `prisma-validate`, `k8s-validate`, `helm-lint`, `secret-scan`
- **Require conversation resolution before merging**: ✅
- **Require signed commits**: Recommended
- **Require linear history**: Recommended
- **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**: ✅

### Merge Requirements Summary

> A PR must pass **11 of 15** checks (excludes coverage, npm audit, Docker build, PR labeler) and have at least **1 approving review** before it can be merged to `main`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests (800 frontend)
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run coverage      # Coverage report
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript check
npm run lint          # ESLint
```

## Smart Contracts

Contracts are in `contracts/`. Build with:

```bash
cd contracts/ophirpay && cargo test   # 58 contract tests
cd contracts/emitter && cargo test    # 6 emitter tests
```

Contract WASM size is enforced in CI (hard limit: 128 KB per contract, the
Soroban protocol limit) and a per-function gas report is uploaded as a build
artifact — see the `contract-gas-report` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main`: `feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`
2. Make your changes, following existing code conventions
3. Run `npm run ci` locally to verify everything passes
4. Push and open a PR — the 15-job CI pipeline runs automatically
5. Ensure all 11 required checks pass (✅ green)
6. Request review from a maintainer (CODEOWNERS auto-assigns reviewers)
7. Once approved and all checks pass, squash-merge to `main`
