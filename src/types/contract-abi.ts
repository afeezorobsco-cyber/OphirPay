/**
 * Contract ABI type definitions for OphirPay Soroban contracts v3.
 * Matches the contracts/ophirpay/src/lib.rs and contracts/emitter/src/lib.rs interfaces.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Escrow: lock funds with deadline, owner release, beneficiary claim, arbiter
 * - Payment Streaming: linear vesting with overflow-protected math
 * - Batch Payments: atomic multi-recipient recording with partial failure
 * - SAC Token Support: works with any Stellar Asset Contract
 * - Native Soroban Events: env.events().publish()
 * - Emergency pause/unpause circuit breaker
 * - Two-step contract upgrade with 24h timelock
 * - Auth-gated emitter contract
 * - Multisig approvals (N-of-M signers)
 * - Spending limits + escalation tiers
 * - Role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Auditor)
 * - On-chain immutable audit log
 * - Recurring payment scheduler (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
 * - Fee configuration per operation type
 * - Timelocked admin actions (24h delay)
 * - DAO governance (proposal → vote → execute)
