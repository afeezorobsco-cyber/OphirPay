/**
 * Periodic job that reconciles submitted payments against their on-chain
 * outcome on Horizon.
 *
 * A payment is "submitted" when its row transitions to SUBMITTED (a signed
 * transaction has been pushed to the network) and a `transactionHash` is
 * recorded. The Stellar ledger can close with a *failed* result even after
 * submission is accepted (e.g. insufficient balance, bad sequence, failed
 * operation), leaving the DB row stuck in SUBMITTED forever.
 *
 * This module reads every payment that is STILL in SUBMITTED state (i.e. not
 * yet resolved to CONFIRMED / FAILED) and, for those that carry a tx hash,
 * queries Horizon for the on-chain outcome:
 *
 *   • succeeded                 → payment marked CONFIRMED
 *   • failed                    → payment marked FAILED (with an error message)
 *   • not yet ingested (404)    → payment left untouched (retried next run)
 *   • Horizon lookup error      → payment left untouched
 *
 * It NEVER touches payments in any other status (unsigned, confirmed,
 * completed, cancelled, …) — the acceptance criterion that the job only
 * touches transactions in pending (so far unresolved) state.
 *
 * Each run is persisted to the `PaymentSyncRun` table so results are
 * surfaced in the admin view and overlapping runs can be prevented.
